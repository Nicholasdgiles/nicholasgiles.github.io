I'm a creative operations manager turned designer, specializing in the UX/UI of entertainment platforms and online communities, with 5 years of experience in the tech industry. I believe design should be useful and universal, with delightful experiences to keep people coming back.

**Inclusive Design:**
I include users throughout the design process in order to build solutions that improve actual peopleâ€™s lives.

**Creative Problem Solving:**
I use tools like Miro, Jira, Qualtrics, Otter.io, Slack, and Google workspace to help me tackle difficult problems, understand user behavior, and collaborate more efficiently.

**Design Systems:**
I enjoy collaborating with other designers in Figma, building component libraries using auto-layout and variants.

### My Background
Before moving into UX design in 2020, I was in creative operations on-site at google and pandora, enabling designers to produce quality work at scale.

At Pandora, I was the Volunteer & Partnerships Lead for the Pride LGBTQ+ resource group where I organized panels, volunteer events, and programming for local Oakland youth.

In addition to being a designer, I am also a dog dad, a gaymer, a listener of good music (lol), and a reader of books on social movements.
