  <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 40px; font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.6em; font-weight: 400px;">I'm Nicholas, a UX/UI designer focused on <i>interaction design</i> and <i>design systems</i>. 📱💻</h3>

  <br><h3>My Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <p><li><strong>Inclusive Design:</strong> including users throughout the design process in order to build user-centered solutions that improve people’s lives.</li></p>
      <p><li><strong>Creative Problem Solving:</strong> using tools like Miro, Jira, Qualtrics, Otter.io, Slack, Notion, and Google Workspace to help me tackle difficult problems, understand users, and collaborate more efficiently.</li></p>
      <p><li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> collaborating with other designers in Figma, building scalable component libraries using auto-layout and variants.</li></p>
    </ul>

<br><h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>Before moving into UX design in 2020, I worked in creative operations on-site at Google and at Pandora, enabling designers to produce quality work at scale.</p>

    <p>In addition to being a designer, I am also a dog dad, a gaymer, a listener of good music (lol), and an avid reader.</p><br>
