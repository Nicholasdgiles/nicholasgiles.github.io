  <p>I'm a creative project manager turned designer, specializing in the UX/UI of entertainment platforms and online communities, with 5 years of experience in the tech industry. I believe design should be useful and universal, with delightful experiences to keep people coming back.</p>

<br><h3>Design Principles</h3>

    <br><h4>Inclusive Design:</h4>
    <p>I include users throughout the design process in order to build solutions that improve actual peopleâ€™s lives.</p>

    <br><h4>Creative Problem Solving:</h4>
    <p>I use tools like Miro, Jira, Qualtrics, Otter.io, Slack, and Google workspace to help me tackle difficult problems, understand user behavior, and collaborate more efficiently.</p>

    <br><h4>Design Systems:</h4>
    <p>I enjoy collaborating with other designers in Figma, building component libraries using auto-layout and variants.</p>


<br><h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>Before moving into UX design in 2020, I was in creative operations on-site at Google and Pandora, enabling designers to produce quality work at scale.</p>

    <p>At Pandora, I was the Volunteer & Partnerships Lead for the Pride LGBTQ+ resource group where I organized panels, volunteer events, and programming for local Oakland youth.</p>

    <p>In addition to being a designer, I am also a dog dad, a gaymer, a listener of good music (lol), and a reader of books on social movements.</p>
