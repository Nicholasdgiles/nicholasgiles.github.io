  <p>I'm a creative project manager turned UX designer with 5 years of experience working with design teams in the Bay Area. I believe design should be useful and universal, using delight to keep people coming back.</p>

  <br><h3>Design Principles</h3>
  <li><h4>Inclusive Design:</h4><p> Users should be included throughout the design process in order to build solutions that improve actual peopleâ€™s lives.</p></li>

    <li><h4>Creative Problem Solving:</h4><p> Using tools like Miro, Jira, Qualtrics, Otter.io, Slack, and Google Workspace helps me tackle difficult problems, understand users, and collaborate more efficiently.</p></li>

    <li><h4>Design Systems:</h4><p> I enjoy collaborating with other designers in Figma, building component libraries using auto-layout and variants.</p></li>


<br><h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>Before moving into UX design in 2020, I was in creative operations on-site at Google and Pandora, enabling designers to produce quality work at scale.</p>

    <p>At Pandora, I was the Volunteer & Partnerships Lead for the Pride LGBTQ+ resource group where I organized panels, volunteer events, and programming for local Oakland youth.</p>

    <p>In addition to being a designer, I am also a dog dad, a gaymer, a listener of good music (lol), and a reader of books about social movements.</p>
