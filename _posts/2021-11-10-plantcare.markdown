### Coming Soon!

I am currently working on the design of a soil moisture sensor device and companion mobile application that will help people take care of their plants. More information will be added here throughout the course of the project, so check back soon!

### Project Overview
* Course: SI 612: Pervasive Interaction Design
* Duration: Aug 2021 - Dec 2021
* Discipline: Interaction Design, UI Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

### Research Methodologies
I conducted a cultural probe in order to learn what motivates people to care for plants and how they feel about plant care. The study was done virtually to ensure safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to mitigate any impact on the data, I created graphical representations of the probe materials to help users get a better feel for what was being asked of them.

The research questions I sought to answer with the cultural probe were:
- What motivates people to take care of plants?
- How does interacting and caring for plants make people feel?
- Does moral support and/or community (accountability) help motivate people to take care of their plants?
- Would education/information on plant care help people care for their plants?
- What are participantsâ€™ pain points/frustrations throughout the plant care process?

The **Plant Care Workbook** helped us gain insights on:
- Basic plant care info and photos
- Participantsâ€™ perception of their plant care work
- Info on local plant care community

The **Plant Care Feelings Workbook** helped us gain insights on:
- Positives: benefits of plant care; how the benefits make participants feel
- Negatives: pain points of plant care; how they make participants feel

The **Plant Care Day Log** served as a mini diary study, and helped us gain insights on:
- Daily plant care work
- How those specific tasks make participants feel
