<p> As a UI/UX designer on the TransUnion 2015 hackathon Team Hackasaurus Rex, I designed the user interface of the web and iOS application and contributed to the marketing and ideation process. In order for our project to be easily integrated into TUâ€™s existing services, the UI was designed to comply with branding guidelines down to pixel perfect detail. </p>
