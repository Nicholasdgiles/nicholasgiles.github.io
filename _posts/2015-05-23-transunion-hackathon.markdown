<p>As a UI/UX designer at the TransUnion 2015 hackathon, I worked with a team to wireframe and prototype a web and mobile iOS application. I also designed the user interface assets that were implemented into the final working prototype. In order for our project to be easily integrated into TransUnionâ€™s existing services, the UI was designed to comply with branding guidelines down to pixel perfect detail.</p>
