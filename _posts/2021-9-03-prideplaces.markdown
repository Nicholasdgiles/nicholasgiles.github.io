### Coming Soon!

This past summer, I was a Product Design Intern at Pride Places, which is an LGBTQ+ directory start-up based in San Francisco, California. I had the opportunity to contribute towards the redesign of their desktop and mobile web applications. More information about the experience will be added here, so check back soon!

### Overview
* Organization: Pride Places
* Role: Product Design Intern
* Location: San Francisco, CA (Remote)
* Duration: May 2021 - Aug 2021
* Discipline: UX Research, Interaction Design, Visual Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Otter.ai


### Audit
The first project I worked on during my internship was the redesign of the "Menu" feature that is only available to business tier subscribers. Developers had yet to implement the existing designs and I was tasked with updating them to be simpler and more modern. In addition to improving the overall UX, I also integrated a handful of recent product and design system changes. I began by conducting a usability audit of the existing designs before improving upon them.

#### Design Components
Next, I built components in Figma for both the mobile and desktop business menu feature using auto-layout and variants. After final designs were approved, I added them to the global component library.
