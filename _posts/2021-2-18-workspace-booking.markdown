### Design Problem

‚ÄúYour school wants to provide dedicated spaces for students to help them focus on their academic studies. Design an experience for students, professors, and members of the school community to reserve work desks/spaces in the library. Consider the experience of checking availability, reserving the space, and reporting any issues.‚Äù

### Approach

For this project I took a user-centered design approach to the design problem. I began by researching competitors and doing **domain research**, and then creating interview protocol and conducting virtual **user interviews** to gather information. From there, I crafted **user personas** and **interaction scenarios**. Next,I was able to align on a core set of features by building a site map that went on to inform the **wireframes**. Using Figma, I designed a **high fidelity prototype**. After gathering additional user feedback, I iterated on the concept to create a "final" version of the high fidelity prototype.

### Research & Discovery

#### Domain research

Through analyzing the mobile and desktop views of Wework, UC Berkeley Library, and University of Michigan Study Spaces websites, I conducted a competitive analysis. Most university websites are available to all, but some contain certain restrictions when it comes to reserving workspaces. These sites offer some form of calendar view, limited search functionality, and typically do not offer a map view. Wework‚Äôs search filters and map view makes it much easier to find available spaces.

#### User Interviews

Here are user interview questions that I formulated in order to gain qualitative data on the domain:
* What motivates people to use workspace reservation products and what basic tasks help them do so successfully?
* What products, services, or methods do school communities currently use to book workspaces?
* What expectations do people have for new products and services?
* What information or wherewithal is required for people to reserve communal study spaces?
* What problems or frustrations do school communities encounter with the existing workspace booking services?

#### Personas

By analyzing the answers to the surveys, the following personas were crafted:

#### User Scenarios

Then I constructed two scenarios based on the personas that would be the starting point for determining core functionality for the minimum viable product.

**Scenario 1: The Careful Planner**
* Looking for a study space at their university that is near their classmates.
* Wants to make sure there are electrical outlets.
* Adds all of this criteria and gets a map view of options.
* Books a study space and invites others.
* Receives a confirmation email & push notification, and adds booking to. personal calendar.
* Receives a push notification reminder prior to reservation.
* Edits the location and time and sends an update to group members.
* Is alerted of another room that has freed up and swaps the rooms out.
* Has a great experience.

**Scenario 2: The Careful Planner**
* Main tasks accomplished in scenario:
* Needs to find a space where their friend who uses a wheelchair can easily access and roll up to the desk.
* Wants to ensure that masks are required in the study space for safety, and other COVID precautions are taken.
* Books the reservation.
* Arrives at the room and notices equipment is missing.
* Reports the issue and chats with staff who helps resolve problem.
* Leaves feedback about the missing electrical slots and malfunctioning equipment.

### Design

#### Site Map

The site map was constructed from the scenario steps and visually mapped to the eventual product information design.
