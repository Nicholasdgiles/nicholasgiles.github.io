### Design Problem

"Biscotti" is a coffee shop that offers the ultimate coffee and biscotti experience. The coffee shop offers indoor and outdoor sitting (when the weather permits) and pick-up/delivery services. They are in need of a new brand design and a digital product (an app or a website).

### Project Overview

#### Sketches

First, I started exploring product options and brainstormed solutions by looking at competitor's products. Then I moved onto sketching possible solutions which helped me hone in on the features and components that would be most important to include.

#### Wireframes

After I aligned on core features, I then crafted wireframes and refined the user experience for the home, menu, checkout, payment method, discounts, and login screens.

### Visual Design

#### Style Guide

The style guide was created with the Biscotti brand in mind. Using the client's creative requirements I was able to decide on primary and secondary colors, spacing, and font choices.

#### High-Fidelity Screens

I then applied the visual style guide to the wireframes in order to create high-fidelity screens. Using the coffee color scheme to make important elements pop, as well as a lot of white space, I was able to create key screens that show the end-to-end shopping and checkout flow.
