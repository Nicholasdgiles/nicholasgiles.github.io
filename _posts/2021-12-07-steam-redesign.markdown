### Design Problem

**App Redesign:** pick an app or digital product with significant flaws in the visual design, look and feel, and UI. Document those flaws, brainstorm alternative solutions, and redesign the application. Focus on the visuals and desired emotional response and address UX issues secondarily. Your finalized submission should contain six or more key redesigned screens, two personas, and a style guide.

### Project Overview
* Course: SI 616: Advanced Visual Design
* Duration: Aug 2021 - Dec 2021
* Discipline: Visual Design, UI Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

### Personas
Two personas were designed to represent key users for a redesigned Steam mobile application. I included contrasting behaviorial characteristics for both of the personas in order to ensure different users' needs would be addressed. The first persona, Alex, focuses on Steam users who have limited income, but ample amount of time to play games with others online.

In contrast, the second persona, Tulio, focuses on users who have disposable income, limited time to play, and enjoy gaming with close friends and family.

### Style Guide
The design system utilizes the existing Steam color scheme with an updated selection, including a heavier use of secondary colors. I used eight 20px columns for the mobile grid to ensure spacing is consistent across screens. Cera Pro was the font family that I selected for this redesign, as it is clean, modern and easily readable in dark mode.

### Wireframes
I audited Steam's existing iOS mobile application to identify key UX and UI improvements. Ultimately, I designed eight wireframes that cover a majority of Steam's core features.

### Design Components
After creating wireframes, I began working on individual design components in Figma. I decided to utilize neumorphic design principles and built components with a 3D material design effect to ensure elements stand out from the dark background.

### High-Fidelity Designs
Eight high-fidelity mobile screens were produced utilizing the updated design components. For the background, I created a few gradients using the updated brand colors.
