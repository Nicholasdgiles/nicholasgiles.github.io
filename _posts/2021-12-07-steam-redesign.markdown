### Design Problem

**App Redesign:** pick an app or digital product with significant flaws in the visual design, look and feel, and UI. Document those flaws, brainstorm alternative solutions, and redesign the application. Focus on visuals and address UX issues secondarily.

### Project Overview
* Course: SI 616: Advanced Visual Design
* Duration: Nov 2021 - Dec 2021
* Discipline: Visual Design, UI Design, UX Research & Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

### Motivation
For this project, I decided to redesign the Steam iOS application, which is a digital product that is in need of a UX/UI overhaul. Additionally, I've used Steam in the past to play games so I am familiar with many of the application's UI and UX issues. From doing a quick assessment, I found that the application has significant UX flaws and utilizes outdated design patterns. In order to further dig into these issues, I decided to conduct a heuristic analysis.

### Heuristic Analysis
A heuristic analysis was conducted in order to uncover UX and UI issues of the Steam iOS application. The features that were analyzed include Profile Setup, Game Search, Game Listings, Item Listings, and Community Marketplace just to name a few.

I began by creating a checklist of the heuristics that should be applied, as well as crafting the individual criteria for each heuristic. Then I documented issues related to Nielsen Norman's ten usability heuristics. The heuristics that had the most issues are included below.

Once I finished creating the heuristic analysis checklist, I rated the severity of each issue and brainstormed recommended solutions. This helped create a list of items to address for the redesign, and a priority ranking for each task.

### Personas
Two personas were designed to represent key users for a redesigned Steam mobile application. I included contrasting behavioral characteristics for both of the personas in order to ensure different users' needs would be addressed. The personas include information on users' favorite apps, which helps with understanding mental models and familiar design patterns. The first persona, Alex, focuses on Steam users who have limited income, but ample amount of time to play games with others online.

In contrast, the second persona, Tulio, focuses on users who have disposable income, limited time to play, and enjoy gaming with close friends and family.

### Style Guide
The design system was created with both of the personas in mind. It utilizes the existing Steam color scheme with an updated selection, including a heavier use of secondary colors. I used eight 20px columns for the mobile grid to ensure spacing is consistent across screens. Cera Pro was the font family that I selected for this redesign, as it is clean, modern and easily readable in dark mode. I utilized icons from the SF symbols library to ensure iconography was consistent and work well with the operating system's UI elements.

### Wireframes
Referencing the heuristic analysis issues and recommendations, I created updated wireframes with UX and UI improvements implemented. Ultimately, I designed eight wireframes that cover a majority of Steam's core features.

### Design Components
After creating wireframes, I began working on individual design components in Figma. I decided to utilize neumorphic design principles and built components with a 3D material design effect to ensure elements stand out from the dark background.

### High-Fidelity Designs
Eight high-fidelity mobile screens were produced utilizing the updated design components. For the background, I created a few gradients using the updated brand colors.

### Reflection
Next steps would include recruiting users for usability tests, utilizing the existing Steam product. This would allow me to validate the initial insights I generated from the heuristic analysis. Then I would take the learnings I generated and iterate on the high-fidelity designs. From there, I would build a quick working prototype in order to test with users.
