### Coming Soon!

I am currently working on a redesign of Steam's mobile iOS application. More information will be added here throughout the course of the project, so check back soon!

### Project Overview
* Course: SI 616: Advanced Visual Design
* Duration: Aug 2021 - Dec 2021
* Discipline: Visual Design, UI Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

### Design Components
I produced components in figma using auto layout and variants in order to more efficiently produce product screens. I applied neumorphic styling to each of the design components to ensure consistent spacing.

### High-Fidelity Designs
I updated Steam's brand identity and applied neumorphic design to their existing visual identity. After building out the updated design system, I created design components and produced eight high-fidelity screens.
