### Coming Soon!

I am currently working on a redesign of Steam's mobile iOS application. More information will be added here throughout the course of the project, so check back soon!

### Project Overview
* Course: SI 616: Advanced Visual Design
* Duration: Aug 2021 - Dec 2021
* Discipline: Visual Design, UI Design
* Tools Used: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

### Personas
Two personas were designed to represent key users for a redesigned Steam mobile application. Relevant behaviorial information was included in place of unnecessary demographic details.

### Style Guide
The design system utilizes the existing Steam color scheme with an updated selection, including a heavier use of secondary colors. I used eight 20px columns for the mobile grid to ensure spacing is consistent across screens. Cera Pro was the font family that I selected for this redesign, as it is clean, modern and easily readable in dark mode.

### Wireframes
I audited Steam's existing iOS mobile application to identify key UX and UI improvements. Ultimately, I selected eight screens to design that will cover a majority of Steam's key features.

### Design Components
After creating wireframes, I began working on individual design components in Figma. I decided to utilize neumorphic design principles and built components with a 3D material design effect to ensure elements stand out from the dark background.

### High-Fidelity Designs
Eight high-fidelity mobile screens were produced utilizing the updated design components. For the background, I created a few gradients using the updated brand colors.
