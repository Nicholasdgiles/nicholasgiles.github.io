### Design Problem

"Biscotti" is a coffee shop that offers the ultimate coffee and biscotti experience. The coffee shop offers indoor and outdoor sitting (when the weather permits) and pick-up/delivery
services. They are in need of a new brand design and a digital product (an app or a website).

### Project Overview

Sketching possible solutions helped me hone in on the features and components that would be most important to include.

#### Wireframes</h4>

I then crafted wireframes and refined the user experience for the home, menu, checkout, payment method, discounts, and login screens.

#### High-Fidelity Screens

I applied the visual style guide to the wireframes in order to create high-fidelity screens.
